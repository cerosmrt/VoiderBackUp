The demons, once trapped inside my head, came back to the surface and I let them tell me things. 
They whispered me secrets I couldn't ignore.

Between backstabbers and abusers, a warrior lays on the floor, craving for living outloud; instead struggles to worship.
It can't be known if it's good, but even things not known are of god's glory.
